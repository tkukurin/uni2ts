# Moirai Agent

Moirai agent is an intelligent forecasting framework that blends historical time series data with external contextual signals to deliver more robust and adaptive predictions than traditional numerical-only models. It leverages large language models as orchestrators to integrate heterogeneous information, select forecasting experts, and adjust forecasts based on real-world context. This makes it especially effective in dynamic environments where context matters as much as past values. This repository provides an early research preview and enables replication of benchmark results for two independent yet composable agents.

Moirai agent supports two core capabilities. First, it enables context-aware forecasting by combining numerical history with external contextual inputs to refine lookback windows, detect anomalies, and anticipate future effects. Second, it performs expert selection through an LLM-based selector that chooses the most suitable forecasting model for each task from a pool of state-of-the-art forecasters.

👉 Standard forecasting results are evaluated on GIFT-Eval, a large-scale benchmark for general time series forecasting: [GIFT-Eval leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Salesforce/gift-eval)

👉 Contextual forecasting results are evaluated on a newly curated benchmark that combines the [CIK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18959) benchmark with additional samples generated by us: [GIFT-CTX Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Salesforce/GIFT-CTX)

This is an open-source research version of Moirai-agent, the code is made available purely for research purposes.
